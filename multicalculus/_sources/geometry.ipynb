    "## Euclidean space\n",
    "Euclidean space is the Euclidean $n$-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry. It is named after the Greek mathematician [Euclid of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid). In his famous book *Elements*, Euclid established foundations of geometry which is now referred to as Euclidean geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern mathematics, Euclidean space is defined as a set of points with certain properties. A point in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is often represented by an $n$-tuple of real numbers. Two fundamental operations (tranlation and rotation) in Euclidean geometry are charaterized by affine space and inner product. Thus, Euclidean space is a set of n-tuple real numbers (i.e., real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$), the space of translations equipped with an inner product. The action of translations makes the space an affine space, and this allows defining lines, planes, subspaces, dimension, and parallelism. The inner product allows defining distance and angles.\n",

    "Real coordinate system ([Ren√© Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes)) for an $n$-dimensional space consists of $n$ orthogonal cooridnate axes. Every point in the space is represented by its coordinates $(x_1, x_2,..., x_n)$ on the $n$ coordinate axes. The coordinates of the origin is $(0,...,0)$.\n",
