    "## Vector field\n",
    "A vector field in the plane is a map assigning to each point $(x, y)$ a vector $\\vec{F}(x, y)=\\langle P(x, y), Q(x, y)\\rangle$. Similarly, a vector field in space assigns to each point $(x, y, z)$ in space a vector $\\vec{F}(x, y, z)=\\langle P(x, y, z), Q(x, y, z), R(x, y, z)\\rangle$.\n",

    "If $f(x, y)$ is a function of two variables, then $\\vec{F}(x, y)=\\nabla f(x, y)$ is called a **gradient field**. Gradient fields in space are of the form $\\vec{F}(x, y, z)=\\nabla f(x, y, z)$. When is a vector field a gradient field? $\\vec{F}(x, y)=\\langle P(x, y), Q(x, y)\\rangle=\\nabla f(x, y)$ implies $Q_x(x, y)=$ $P_y(x, y)$. If this does not hold at some point, $F$ is not a gradient field.\n",
