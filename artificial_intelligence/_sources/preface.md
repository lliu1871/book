# Preface

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, perception, decision-making, and natural language processing. AI technologies include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

AI is used in a wide range of applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, chatbots, recommendation systems, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, and autonomous vehicles.

The field of AI has been growing rapidly in recent years, driven by advances in computer processing power, data storage, and algorithms. AI has the potential to transform many industries and sectors, from healthcare and finance to transportation and manufacturing, and is expected to have a significant impact on society in the years to come.
