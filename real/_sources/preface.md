# Preface
In mathematics, real analysis investigates the properties and behavior of real numbers, as well as sequences and series of real numbers, and real functions. Key aspects studied in real analysis include convergence, limits, continuity, smoothness, differentiability, and integrability of real-valued sequences and functions.
