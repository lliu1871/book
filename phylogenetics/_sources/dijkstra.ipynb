    "A network involves nodes and edges. The following directed network involves 6 nodes and 7 directed edges. The number on each directed edge denotes the length of the edge. Suppose each node represents a city and each arrow represents a one-way road between two cities. The number on each arrow is the distance between two cities. For example, the arrow between nodes B and D indicates that you can go from B to D with distance 10, but not from D to B. \n",
