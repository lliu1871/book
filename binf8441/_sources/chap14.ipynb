    "How do we estimate mutation rates from DNA sequences? We often count the number $x$ of different nucleotides between two sequences and use the ratio $x/n$ to estimate the mutation rate where $n$ is the number of nucleotides in the DNA sequences. For example, there are two sites with different nucleotides in the following two DNA sequences. Thus, the mutation rate is $2/10 = 0.2$ which is the number of mutations per site. \n",

    "In this example, we count the first site AA as no-mutation but count the site AC as a single mutation. However, the nucleotide A in the first site may first mutate to T and then mutate back to A. Then, there should be two mutations. Simply counting the number of different nucleotides will underestimate the number of mutations. We need a model which allows multiple mutations to accurately estimate the mutation rate. \n",

    "The substitution model is a continuous time Markov chain describing how a single nucleotide evolves over a continuous time $t$. Let $X_t$ be the nucleotide at time $t$. The state space is finite, i.e., $(A,C,G,T)$. Let $\\pi_t = \\left(\\pi_t(A),\\pi_t(C),\\pi_t(G),\\pi_t(T)\\right)$ be the probability distribution of $X_t$. \n",

    "## Transition probability matrix\n",
    "The transition probabilities $P(t)$ for nucleotides is a 4\n",
    "by 4 matrix, in which $P_{ij}(t)$ is the probability that nucleotide $i$\n",

    "The rate matrix $Q$ describes\n",
    "the rate at which nucleotides of one type mutate to nucleotides of\n",
    "another type, i.e., $Q_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$ is the substitution rate at which\n",
    "nucleotide $i$ mutates to nucleotide $j$. The diagonals of the $Q$ matrix are\n",
    "chosen so that the rows sum to zero. Since the diagonal values are determined, they are often replaced by a dash in the $Q$ matrix.\n",

    "For the Jukes-Cantor model, the limiting probabilities are\n",

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitution models can be used to calculate distance between two DNA\n",
    "sequences. A simple distance measure (called p-distance) between two sequences is defined as\n",
    "the proportion of different nucleotides. For example, the p-distance of\n",
    "the following two sequences is 1/5.\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "AAAAA\\\\\n",
    "AAATA\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{caution}\n",
    "The p-distance does not consider multiple mutations and\n",
    "may underestimate the distance between two sequences.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the distance measures derived from substitution models can\n",
    "make a correction for multiple mutations. Considering the Jukes-Cantor\n",
    "model, in which the transition probabilities are given by\n",

    "$$P_{ij}(t) = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n",

    "\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of different nucleotides is\n",
    "$p = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{4}e^{- ut}$, from which we find the \n",
