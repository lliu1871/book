## Group
````{prf:definition} Semigroup
A semigroup is a set $S$ together with an associative binary operation ⋅, i.e., $(a⋅b)⋅c=a⋅(b⋅c)$ for $a,b,c\in S$.
````

````{prf:definition} Group
A group is a semigroup $S$ with an identity element $e$ such that for any $a\in S$, $a⋅e=e⋅a=a$ and there exists a unique $b\in S$ such that $a⋅b=e$ where $b$ is called the inverse of $a$ and denoted by $a^{-1}.$
````


````{prf:definition} Abelian group 
An abelian group is a commutative group in which the binary operation is commutative, i.e., $a⋅b=b⋅a$ for $a,b\in S$.
````

## Ring
````{prf:definition} Ring
A ring is a set $E$ endowed with two binary operation addition $(x,y)\mapsto x+y$ and multiplication $(x,y)\mapsto xy$ such that $E$ is an abelian group under addition, $E$ is a semigroup under multiplication, and for $a,b,c\in E$, $a(b+c)=ab+ac$ and $(a+b)c=ac+bc$.
````

A ring $E$ is said to be **unitary** if it has a multiplicative identity element. A **division ring** is a unitary ring in which the non-zero elements form a group under multiplication. A ring is **commutative** if the multiplication is commutative. 

````{prf:definition} Subring 
A subring of a ring $R$ is a subset $S$ of $R$ that is a ring, using the same operations as defined on and having the same multiplicative identity as $R$.
````

## Ideal
````{prf:definition} Ideal
A nonempty subset $I$ of a ring $R$ is an ideal if $I$ is closed under subtraction and multiplication by any ring member $r\in R$. 
````

Let $S$ be a subset of a ring $R$ with identity. The set $〈S〉=\{r_1 s_1+\dots+r_n s_n |r_i\in R,s_i\in S,n≥1\}$ of all finite linear combination of elements of $S$ is an ideal in $R$, which is called the ideal generated by $S$. It is the smallest ideal of $R$ containing $S$.
	
The intersection of any collection of ideals is an ideal
If $I_1\subseteq I_2\dots$ is an ascending sequence of ideals, each one contained in the net, then the union $⋃I_k$ is also an ideal.

````{prf:definition} Coset
Let $S$ be a subset of a commutative ring R with identity. The set $a+S=\{a+s|s\in S\}$ is called a coset of $S$. The element a is called a coset representative for $a+S$.
````

````{prf:definition}
The set of all cosets, denoted by $\frac{R}{S}=\{a+S|a\in R\}$, is a ring if and only if $S$ is an ideal. In this case, $\frac{R}{I}$ is called the quotient ring of $R$ modulo $I$.
````

````{prf:definition} Maximum ideals
An ideal $I$ in a ring $R$ is a maximal ideal if $I\neq R$ and if whenever $J$ is an ideal satisfying $I\subseteq J\subseteq R$ then either $J=I$ or $J=R$.
````

Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity. Then the quotient ring $\frac{R}{I}$ is a field if and only if $I$ is a maximal ideal.

Any commutative ring R with identity contains a maximal ideal

## Integral Domain
````{prf:definition} Integral domain
An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of two non-zero elements is nonzero.
````

Let $R$ be a ring. A nonzero element $r\in R$ is called a zero divisor if there exists a nonzero $s\in R$ for which $rs=0$. 

A commutative ring $R$ with identity is called an integral domain if it contains no zero divisors.

Let R be a commutative ring with identity. Then $R$ is an integral domain if and only if the cancellation law holds $rx=ry$, $r\neq 0\Rightarrow x=y$

## Principal integral domains
````{prf:definition}
Let $R$ be a ring with identity. The principal ideal generated by $a\in R$ is the ideal $〈a〉=\{ra|r\in R\}$. 
````

````{prf:definition}
An integral domain $R$ in which every ideal is a principal ideal is called a principal integral domain.
````

The integers form a principal ideal domain. In fact, any ideal $I$ in $Z$ is generated by the smallest positive integer $a$ that is contained in $I$
The ring $F[x]$ is a principal ideal domain. In fact, any ideal $I$ is generated by the unique monic polynomial of smallest degree contained in $I$. Moreover, for polynomials $p_1 (x),\dots,p_n (x)$, $〈p_1 (x),\dots,p_n (x)〉=〈gcd⁡(p_1 (x),\dots,p_n (x)) 〉$.
	
Any principal ideal domain R satisfies the ascending chain condition

````{prf:definition} Prime
Let $R$ is an integral domain. A nonzero nonunit $p\in R$  is said to be prime if $p|ab\Rightarrow p|a$ or $p|b$.
````

````{prf:definition} Irreducible elements
A nonzero nonunit $r\in R$  is said to be irreducible if $r=ab\Rightarrow a=1$ or $b=1$.
````

Let $R$ be a principal ideal domain. 1) An $r\in R$ is irreducible if and only if the ideal 〈r〉 is maximal. 2) An element in $R$ is prime if and only if it is irreducible.


````{prf:definition} Unique Factorization Domains 
An integral domain $R$ is said to be a unique factorization domain if it has the following factorization properties: 
1. Every nonzero nonunit element $r\in R$ can be written as a product of a finite number of irreducible elements. 
2. The factorization into irreducible elements is unique in the sense that if $r=p_1\dots p_m$ and $r=q_1\dots q_n$ are two such factorizations then $m=n$ and after a suitable reindexing of the factors, $p_i$ and $q_i$ are associates.
````

- Every principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain

```{admonition} Characteristic of a ring
Let $R$ be a ring with identity. The smallest positive integer $c$ for which $c1=0$ is called the characteristic of $R$. If no such number c exists, we say that $R$ has characteristic 0. The characteristic of $R$ is denoted by $char(R)$.
```

- Any finite ring has nonzero characteristic. Any finite field has prime characteristic

````{prf:definition} Field
A field is a commutative division ring.
````

````{prf:definition} Algebras 
An algebra A over a field $F$ is a nonempty set together with three operations, called addition (denoted by $+$), scalar multiplication and multiplication for which the following properties hold: 
1. A is a vector space over $F$ under addition and scalar multiplication. 
2. A is a ring under addition and multiplication. 
3. If $r\in F$ and $a,b\in A$ then $r(ab)=(ra)b=a(rb)$
