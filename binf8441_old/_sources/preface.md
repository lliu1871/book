# Preface
This is the text for a one-semester statistics course. The course is designed for the bioinformatics students to understand the basic concepts in statistical inference. The prerequisite is a univariate calculus course. Some familiarity with linear algebra is assumed as well. 

The book consists of 15 lectures and 15 labs. The lectures cover statistical theories necessary for developing computational tools for statistical inference. During the labs, we conduct statistical inference in R.
